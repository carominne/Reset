All the data is gathered with Julia (.jl) files and all the postprocessing is done with Matlab (.m) files. 

# Julia (.jl) files
All computational experiments are launched thanks to a *Simu_... .jl* calling a function with the differential equations of the conductance based models (neuronal model) and the synaptic weight change (plasticity rules) found in *model_... .jl*. The common methodology/parameters for all codes are explained below:

## Simu_ ... .jl (main code) 

#### Simulation parameters
* *T* is the total duration of the simulation
* *dt* is the time step used for the resolution of ODEs with explicit Euler's method

#### Model parameters (global)
* gather the global parameters used for conductance-based modeling of all cells (Nernst Potentials, membrane capacitances)

#### Model parameters (mean) - Ecells
* gather the parameters used for the ionic conductance of  each cells (E is the presynaptic cell, C the postsynaptic and I the inhibitory cell)

#### Plasticity parameters
* gather the parameters specific of each plasticity rules. The different set of parameters are commented. If the user needs to change the set of parameter of one model, it needs to be done by hand. 
* *wMax* & *wMin* are the hard bounds set for the synaptic weight.

#### Applied currents
* *Iapp* is the constant current applied to the cell, *Istep* a step current applied for a pairing protocol.
* *duration* is the duration of the step current occuring at a given frequency for a pairing protocol.
* *delay_pre* is the $ \Delta t$ imposed between the pre and postsynaptic cell for a pairing protocol.

#### Connectivity
* gather connectivity parameters between the cells such as *AMPA* and *GABA_A*, *GABA_B* connectivities. In this paper, the postsynaptic cell (C) receives *AMPA* input and both pre- and postsynaptic cells have *GABA_A* and *GABA_B* channels activated by the inhibitory cell.

## model_ ... . jl (ODEs)

#### Functions for the differential equations of...
* The membrane voltage, $V_m$, 
$ C_{m} \frac{V_{m}}{dt} = -\sum I + I_{app} $
 
where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, $I$ is the $i$-th current due to ionic channels $i$, $I_{app}$ is an external applied current. Ionic currents are voltage-dependent; they are expressed as follow:

$$ I = g m^{p}(V_m) h^{q}(V_m) (V_m - E)  $$

where $g$ is the maximal conductance, $m$ is the activation variable, $h$ is the inactivation variable,
$p$ is an integer between 1 and 4, $q$ is either 0 or 1, and $E$ is the reversal potential of the channel.

* The activation and inactivation variables m and p: 

$$  \tau_{m}(V_m)\frac{dm}{dt} = m_{i,\infty}(V_m) - m $$
$$ \tau_{h}(V_m)\frac{dh}{dt} = h_{i,\infty}(V_m) - h $$

* The AMPA and GABA connectivities $$ \frac{s_{AMPA}{dt} $$, $$ \frac{s_{GABA_A}{dt} $$, $$ \frac{s_{GABA_B}{dt} $$. 

* The plasticity rule used

$$ \frac{dw}{dt} = ... $$

#### function_ ...

A function simulating the computational experiment and simulating the ODEs above with Euler explicit method for each time step *z* and each cell *j*. 
Note: j=1-> presynaptic cell ; j = 2-> inhibitory cell ; j = 3-> postsynaptic cell.

## Data acquisition

* *Simu_scenario* and *model_scenario* used to simulate the scenario of **Figure 1B** with Triplet model.
* *Simu_STDP_..* and *model_STDP_..* used for **Figure 2C** (reproducing the experimental pairing protocol of Bi and Poo, 1998)
* *Simu_SJO_..* and *model_SJO_..* used for **Figure 2C** (reproducing the experimental pairing protocol of Sjöström et. al., 2001)
* *Simu_BurstMAT_..* and *model_BurstMAT_..* for **Figure 3A** (simulating the homeostatic reset and saturation for each plasticity rule. Note that for phenomenological models (pair-based and triplet) hard bounds and soft bounds are applied with parameter SB = 0 and SB = 1. )
* *Simu_????????????_..* and *model_STDP_..* for **Figure 3B** (simulating 10 different networks with different ionic conductances (10% variability) for each cell.) 
* *Simu_network* and *model_network* for **Figure 3C** (simulating a 6cells feedforward network with 3 presynaptic cells connected to 3 postsynaptic cells governed by the same inhibitory cell. All initial synaptic weights between pre-post cells are randomly initialized and cells show 30% variability in their $g_{CaT}$ and $g_{KCa} conductances.)
